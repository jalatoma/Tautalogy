# Tautalogy Simplifier
First project completed in Fall 2021 CSCI 2041. It is a simple tautology checker.

## Introduction
Propositional logic is a branch of mathematics that deals with the Boolean constants true and false, with variables that have Boolean values, and with the Boolean operators ¬ (not), ∧ (and), ∨ (or), → (implication), and ↔ (equivalence). An expression constructed from these constants, variables, and operators has a value that depends on the values of its variables. For example, the expression a ∨ (b ∧ c) is true if a is true, or if both b and c are true; it is false otherwise. An expression is a tautology if it is true for all possible values of its variables. For example, the expression ¬ (p ∧ q) → (¬ p ∨ ¬ q) is a tautology, because it is true for all Boolean values of its variables p and q.

In this assigment, we will write code in OCaml simplifying a tautology expression into it's simplest form while applying normalizing and simplifying rules on the expressions.
